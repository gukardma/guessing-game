Setup (you shouldn't need to do this, just for reference, or if you need to install anything)

1. Install node with your installer (I use homebrew for Mac, had to uninstall and reinstall), check that "npm -v" gives you the current version and not an error
2. Ensure node version >=20 (node -v)
3. cd to directory where project will be (frontend folder in this case)\
4. Run "npm create vite@latest"
5. Choose your config options in setup, and for project name "." places project in current directory
6. Run npm install (adds node modules)

Running:

1. cd to correct folder (frontend)
2. Run "npm run dev"
